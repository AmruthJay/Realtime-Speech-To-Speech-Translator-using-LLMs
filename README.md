# Realtime-Speech-To-Speech-Translator-using-LLMs
Developed a Realtime Speech-to-Speech Translator using LLMs - Powered by Ollama

The Models used:
1. Llama2 - 8B
2. Phi3 - 3.8B
3. Llama3 - 8B

Out of these 3, Phi3 was quick, but its not soo accurate. Llama3 is slower , but gives very good translation with regional language support (Mostly). Llama2 was a mix of both.
(Results were based on M1 Macbook Air)
